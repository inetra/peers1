  The MinGW GNU make command can be used to build STLport with different
compilers

  If you use the MSys console be carefull about what make command
you are using. STLport comes with a GNU make build system design
for unix like platforms, make files have not been adapted for the
Windows platform. So you have to use the make command coming with
the MinGW package 'mingw32-make' and not the one coming with MSys
that is a portage of the GNU make for Windows.

- gcc (native compiler):

  Makefile : gcc.mak

  Notes:

    1. Static library (archive)

    If you use the static version of the STLport libraries
  you have to define the _STLP_USE_STATIC_LIB macro in order
  to have your executable linked correctly.

    2. Shell

    You can build STLport using MinGW in two different shells MSys
  or the Windows Command shell. If you use the Windows Command shell
  you will have to signal it using the configure.bat script like that:

      configure -c gcc

    This is necessary because Windows Command shell is very limitated
  in introspection actions that are performed in a classic GNU shell.
  There is no GNU tool like sed or awk available.

    3. Threading configuration

    STLport libraries are built per default in order to be used in a
  multithreaded environment. Under MinGW it means that we use the '-mthread'
  compiler option. Don't forget to add it to your compiler command line too
  if you want to use STLport libraries. You can also ask for not thread
  safe libraries using the --no-thread configure script option.

  Makefile : bcc.mak

- Digital Mars C++ compiler:

  Makefile : dmc.mak
